# DOA Estimation of Coherent Sources Using Residual Network-based Subspace Reconstruction

(The paper has been submitted to ICASSP 2025, and the code will be uploaded soon.)

## Directory description

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Proposed_method**: Contains the implementation of the proposed method based on residual network-based subspace reconstruction.
- **E2E_CNN**: Contains the code for the E2E_CNN method used for comparison.
- **E2E_CV_CNN**: Contains the code for the E2E_CV_CNN method, also used for comparison.
- **Test**: Contains simulation results. This directory includes performance comparisons with traditional methods such as MUSIC, CBF, MVDR, PM, etc.
- **Matlab_plot**: Contains scripts for plotting the test results.
- **Real_Scenario_Test**: Contains data, code, and results for real-world scenario testing.
